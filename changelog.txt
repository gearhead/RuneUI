•   Hostname changes work on the fly, all dependant variables modified, and dependant jobs restarted.
•   Fixed some issues with Spotify, however Spotify no longer works due to changes made by Spotify in May 2018. Settings UI text included to explain this.
•   Global Random works truly randomly using ashuffle for randomly playing playlists or the complete MPD library. On/off switches included in the Settings UI.

Default settings are based on the Pi type on initial start-up. Automatic output device configuration based on MPD settings. Artist-info, lyrics and screen-saver now work in the same way for MPD and Airplay. SoXr for Airplay is included but disabled.

•   Casting MP3 via UPnP/DLNA has sound quality problems, other file formats are OK. See here for the probable cause: http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/digital-output-and-input-for-runeaudio-t6592.html
