RuneAudio change log 0.5b > 0.6b
--------------------------------

OS and environment:
    All Raspberry Pi models, except the Pi 5B, supported (including the Pi 3A+, Pi 4B and Zero 2W).
    Added a Rasbian-OS (RPiOS-bullseye) based Linux variant to the RuneAudio which can be used on all Pi models.
        Currently at Linux v6.1.21.
    Added a ARCH Arm aarch64 64-bit Linux variant (for Pi 3A+, 3B+, 4B and Zero 2W), currently at Linux v6.1.43-1.
    We previously patched the kernel to support sample rates up to 384KHz. Our changes are now included as
        standard in the kernel.
    Latest Linux file location standards have been implemented.
    All new configuration (.pacnew) files reviewed and relevant updates implemented.
    Upgraded PHP to version 7.x (RPiOS) or 8.x (ARCH), the previous version 3.x was end-of-life. Almost all the
        code updated to implement the changed and stricter syntax of v8.x.
    Partially upgraded composer components to their latest versions.
    All standard and custom packages updated.
    Retired the ARCH Arm image for armv6 (for Pi A, Pi B and Pi Zero), this is now end of life, ARCH Linux stopped
        supporting it at Linux v5.15.35-1. We have a version running at Linux v6.1.11-2, but this version is no
        longer distributed or supported.
    Retired the ARCH Arm image for armv7 (for Pi 2B, Pi 3A, Pi 3A+, Pi3B, 3B+, 4B and Zero 2W), this is in
        principle still supported by ARCH Arm Linux. We have a version running at Linux v6.1.21-3, but due to poor
        support from ARCH Arm Linux this version is no longer distributed or supported.
Reworked output audio card management:
    Support for latest Linux configuration and definitions for on-board audio cards (3,5 mm & HDMI).
    Two HDMI audio output's available when these are connected connected at boot time (Pi4).
    'vc4' HDMI audio output supported.
    Automatic detection and configuration of unknown audio cards (USB devices and manually set-up audio cards).
        This works with most audio output devices, but not all.
    Choice of hardware or software volume control removed. Replaced with volume control on/off.
    Automatic selection of hardware volume control when available. Software volume control is selected when no
        hardware volume control is available.
    The name of the audio-card presented in the MPD UI is the same as the one selected in the Settings UI.
    USB audio devices are Plug & Play, without a reboot (i2S audio cards still need a reboot after selection).
    Updated the list of supported audio cards.
Added CD-Drive audio input:
    Self powered USB CD-Drives can now be used as a source for music.
    Auto-play on CD-detect is selectable.
    CD-track of full CD selection supported via the library tab.
Added hardware audio card input:
    Input audio card capabilities are automatically detected and the optimum quality settings are used.
    Input audio card selection supported via the library tab.
    The idea is that this could be used for USB based vinyl turntables or alsa/USB based DAB radio input.
Reworked Sound Signature (optimization profiles):
    Bugs selecting profiles for Pi1 (armv6) hardware fixed.
    Removed MPD priority resetting since MPD now dynamically resets its own priority to real-time speeds.
    Removed other process priority resetting, this is done elsewhere.
    Removed depreciated kernel tuning settings.
    The routines to correctly return to previous/default kernel setting when switching profiles fixed (previously
        a reboot after changes was required).
    Added new profiles for Pi2, Pi3, and Pi4 based on 'Dynobot' and 'Frost_dk' forum posts.
    Modified debug to show all the 'tweaked' kernel settings.
Reworked UI notifications/messages:
    Unified the UI notification/message routines. They now work.
Main Player UI:
    Meta-data and Album-art sourced from internet when playing web-radio's.
    Presentation order of the main player UI objects can be modified in the /dev UI.
    Large and small art images (album cover and artist photo art) in screen saver UI's interchangeable via /dev
        menu setting.
    MPD metadata, albumart and information for the next song is pre-loaded while playing the preceding song.
    Lyrics can also be sourced from lyrics files or embedded metadata tags in the music files.
    Lyrics validation quality routines reworked.
    Control settings for lyrics added to the /dev menu.
Alsa Web mixer:
    Added 'Mixer' (WebUI Alsa Mixer) to the menu. The 'WebUI Alsa Mixer' has been available since 0.4b as a poorly
        documented feature.
    Modified WebUI Alsa Mixer UI presentation to have a similar look and feel to RuneAudio.
    WebUI Alsa Mixer navigation modified to work correctly in the local browser.
    WebUI Alsa Mixer also includes Bluetooth bluealsa devices, when applicable.
Volume control:
    RuneAudio will always initially start up using a volume control, set at 40%.
    Whenever RuneAudio switches from playing a streaming service (AirPLay, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, etc.) to
        MPD, the volume will be reset to the last value set in MPD.
    The volume control in the player UI is dimmed and disabled when not active.
    In addition to the existing 'enabled', 'disabled' options in the volume control setup options the option
        'disabled & hide the volume control' included.
    Presentation problems when scaling the volume control for small screens fixed.
    Initialisation problems with volume up and down buttons in combination with the mute button fixed.
    Centre of the volume control (volume level) is now the same colour as the centre of the countdown timer.
    Centre of the volume control (volume level) is clickable for mute/unmute in the same style as pause/restart
        using the countdown timer.
Library management:
    Main Library options not shown when they cannot be used.
    Added: 'Add next' to the library music and web-radio selection choices.

Other:
    Cookbook for image generation reworked with improved automated package version testing.
    New cookbook for the Rasbian based RPiOS image.
    Image reset script, for automated image deployment, improved to support the latest modifications.
    All source code tided up, inconstant use of tabs, spaces, etc. corrected.
    Default cpu temperature limit set to 75'C.
    Added under-power, overheating and throttling diagnostics in debug (primarily for the Pi B4 model).
    Under-clocking features for the Pi3 and Pi4 models is available in the /dev menu. The lower speed is intended
        to lower the operating temperature and therefore reduce noise. Passive cooling on a Pi B4 could also be
        possible.
    Improved reporting concerning Pi type and Linux type in Debug and the Settings > Status UI.
    Automatic setting of the time-zone after initial boot.
    Automatic setting of the Wi-Fi regulatory domain country code. This improves Wi-Fi reliability and in most
        countries allows higher transmission power.

    Availability of internet services are now tracked, features are automatically disabled when the required
        services are unavailable.
    When MPD cannot determine the values for some high-resolution audio types, 'getid3' is used to determine
        playback rates (bit rate & sample rate).
    Variable bit rate playback rates are shown as average bit rate (for example FLAC and some MP3 encoding).
    Fixed some bugs in the amixer-webui.
    Asynchronous 'jobs' are run sequentially (fifo) in the background, which helps to keep memory use to a minimum
        for the low-memory Pi systems.
    ZeroClipboard, used for copying the debug text to the clipboard, removed and replaced due to its dependency on
        end-of-life Adobe Flash Player.
    Pre-configured to use gpio-ir overlays replacing depreciated lirc for Infra-Red remote control.
    Smart semi-persistent generic cache implemented for album art, song metadata and artist information.
    Reworked Debug UI data and processing.
    The MPD logfile size is tracked and recycled when too big.
    PHP opcache size is automatically optimised.
    Caching for CIFS mounts enabled by default.
    Some general UI reorganisation and textual changes.
    A number of 'Advanced settings' added to the /dev UI.
    Tool uglify-js implemented to minimise/optimise JavaScript files.
    Updated credits.
