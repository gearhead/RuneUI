RuneAudio reset Linux root password at boot
===========================================

To reset the Linux root password, create a file in the /boot/password directory. This
'readme' file which you are now reading is located in the correct directory.

This action should be carried out on your PC after inserting the Micro-SD card, the
directory then appears as /password, (for Mac users, this is in the first disk partition).

The file can have any name except 'readme', its content is ignored and can be empty.

After creating the file on the micro-SD card, replacing the card in your RuneAudio player
and restarting RuneAudio it will prompt for a new Linux root password.
