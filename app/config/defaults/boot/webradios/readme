RuneAudio webradios import at boot
==================================

Create one or more files in the /boot/webradios directory (or on RPiOS Bookworm the directory is /boot/firmware/webradios).
The files should contain the lines:
---
[playlist]
NumberOfEntries=1
File1=<webradio_url>
Title1=<webradio_name>
---

Where <webradio_url> is the url of the webradio_name
and <webradio_name> is the description of the webradio_name
The Filename should be <webradio_name>.pls

By copying all of your webradio files into the /boot/webradios directory (or on RPiOS Bookworm the
directory is /boot/firmware/webradios) they will be automatically imported.

This action can be carried out on your PC after inserting the Micro-SD card, the
directory then appears as /webradios, (for Mac users, this is on the first disk partition).

Duplicates already in RuneAudio will not be replaced. The files will be deleted after importing them into RuneAudio.
Use the RuneAudio backup feature to save your configuration, including playlists and webradios.
See menu Settings.

It is sometimes difficult to find the URL of Radio streams. The Radio companies try to hide
these so that users are forced to use their websites, which is done to try to create a fanbase and
create advertising revenue. I suppose it is to be expected.
Here is a list of radio stations and their URL's: https://www.hendrikjansen.nl/henk/streaming.html
It's a Dutch webpage, but understandable. You can find other lists like this one on internet.

Example:
---
Filename: 'UK BBC Radio 4.pls'
---
[playlist]
NumberOfEntries=1
File1=http://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_radio4fm_mf_p.m3u
Title1=UK BBC Radio 4
