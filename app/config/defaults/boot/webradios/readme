RuneAudio webradios setup at boot
=================================

Create one or more files in the /boot/webradios directory which contain the lines:
---
[playlist]
NumberOfEntries=1
File1=<webradio_url>
Title1=<webradio_name>
---

Where <webradio_url> is the url of the webradio_name
and <webradio_name> is the description of the webradio_name
The Filename should be <webradio_name>.pls

By copying all of your webradio files into then /boot/webradios directory they will be
automatically imported.

Duplicates already in RuneAudio will not be replaced. The files will be deleted after importing them into RuneAudio.
Use the RuneAudio backup feature to save your configuration, including playlists and webradios.
See menu Settings.

It is sometimes difficult to find the URL of Radio streams. The Radio companies try to hide
these so that users are forced to use their websites, which try to create a fanbase and create
advertising revenue for them. I suppose it is to be expected.
Here is a list of radio stations and their URL's: https://www.hendrikjansen.nl/henk/streaming.html
It's a Dutch webpage, but understandable. You can find other lists like this one on internet.

Example:
---
Filename: 'UK BBC Radio 4.pls'
---
[playlist]
NumberOfEntries=1
File1=http://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_radio4fm_mf_p.m3u
Title1=UK BBC Radio 4
