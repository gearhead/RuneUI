#                           (default "100000")
#   i2c_baudrate            An alias for i2c_arm_baudrate
#   i2s                     Set to "on" to enable the i2s interface
#                           (default "off")
#   krnbt                   Set to "on" to enable autoprobing of Bluetooth
#                           driver without need of hciattach/btattach
#                           (default "off")
#   krnbt_baudrate          Set the baudrate of the PL011 UART when used
#                           with krnbt=on
#   leds_off                If set to 'true' the onboard indicator LEDs

#                           requests 50MHz
#   sd_poll_once            Looks for a card once after booting. Useful
#                           for network booting scenarios to avoid the
#                           overhead of continuous polling. N.B. Using
#                           this option restricts the system to using a
#                           single card per boot (or none at all).
#                           (default off)
#   sd_force_pio            Disable DMA support for SD driver (default off)

#   tx_lpi_timer            Set the delay in microseconds between going idle
#                           and entering the low power state (default 600).
#                           Requires EEE to be enabled - see "eee".
#   uart0                   Set to "off" to disable uart0 (default "on")
#   uart1                   Set to "on" or "off" to enable or disable uart1
#                           (default varies)
#   watchdog                Set to "on" to enable the hardware watchdog
#                           (default "off")
#   act_led_trigger         Choose which activity the LED tracks.
#                           Use "heartbeat" for a nice load indicator.
#                           (default "mmc")
#   act_led_activelow       Set to "on" to invert the sense of the LED
#                           (default "off")
#                           N.B. For Pi 3B, 3B+, 3A+ and 4B, use the act-led
#                           overlay.
#   act_led_gpio            Set which GPIO to use for the activity LED
#                           (in case you want to connect it to an external
#                           device)
#                           (default "16" on a non-Plus board, "47" on a
#                           Plus or Pi 2)
#                           N.B. For Pi 3B, 3B+, 3A+ and 4B, use the act-led
#                           overlay.
#   pwr_led_trigger
#   pwr_led_activelow
#   pwr_led_gpio            As for act_led_*, but using the PWR LED.
#                           Not available on Model A/B boards.
#
#   N.B. It is recommended to only enable those interfaces that are needed.
#   Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour (i2c_vc
#   interfering with Pi Camera, I2S and SPI hogging GPIO pins, etc.)
#   Note also that i2c, i2c_arm and i2c_vc are aliases for the physical
#   interfaces i2c0 and i2c1. Use of the numeric variants is still possible
#   but deprecated because the ARM/VC assignments differ between board
#   revisions. The same board-specific mapping applies to i2c_baudrate,
#   and the other i2c baudrate parameters.

#   Overclocking is not required for the Pi 2B, 3B, 3B+, 4B and Zero 2W models
#   See internet for documentation on overclocking options for A, B and Zero
#       models, be careful, check 2 independent sources!

#
##  General CPU settings ##
#   Setting the governor to force turbo on (=1) can invalidates warranty in combination with some (higher)
#       overclocking settings for some models. We do this to try to keep the clocks in the Pi running at a
#       consistent speed, many audio cards use this clock. For higher speed Pi models with USB DAC's or master
#       mode DAC's it is probably not a requirement. Switching it off will make the PI run cooler
#   Alternative is turbo on demand (=0)
force_turbo=1
#force_turbo=0
#   Lowering max CPU temperature from 85 (standard) to 70 or 75 degrees gives some headroom when turbo is set
#   If the max temp is reached the cpu will automatically be throttled back
#       Heatsinks are a good idea on Pi 3 and 4 models, a ventilator (fan) should be used on the Pi 4
temp_limit=75
#   Boot delay sometimes needs to be set to higher values when overclocking is enabled
#       Default boot delay is 1 second, 3B+ needs a delay of 2
boot_delay=2
