Any file name can be used. Use a text editor on your PC to create the files, after flashing the Micro-SD card.
Only lines beginning with 'Name=', 'Passphrase=' and 'Hidden=' will be processed.
The groups of values can be repeated in a single file. Each time a line is encountered beginning with 'Name='
a new profile is defined.
