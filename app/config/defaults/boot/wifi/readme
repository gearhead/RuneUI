RuneAudio Wi-Fi setup at boot
=============================

Create one or more files in the wifi directory which contain the lines:
---
Name=<ssid>
Passphrase=<passphrase>
---

Optionally the following line can also be added:
---
Hidden=[true|false]
---

Any file name can be used. Use a text editor on your PC to create the files, after flashing the Micro-SD card.
Only lines beginning with 'Name=', 'Passphrase=' and 'Hidden=' will be processed.
The groups of values can be repeated in a single file. Each time a line is encountered beginning with 'Name='
a new profile is defined.

There are some example files in the directory /wifi/examples.

All user created files in the wifi directoy will be processed and deleted during the RuneAudio startup process, regardless of the success of the processing.

If you screw up your network configuration you can also use this function to recreate valid wifi profiles.

Example:
---
this line will be ignored
Name=My network name
Passphrase=my P@66w0rd
Hidden=false
adi this line will be ignored
Hidden this line will be ignored
---
