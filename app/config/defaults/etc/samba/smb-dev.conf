#| Introduction RuneAudio Samba configuration file |#
#|   This is smb-dev.conf for Read/Write access    |#
# ------------------------------------------------- #
#####################################################
#
# Samba is installed on your RuneAudio configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: If you change to DEV mode (using the options in the /dev menu) critical files become 
# read and write accessible to everyone on your network and NO password is required by default! Dont 
# forget to switch DEV mod off!
#
# You can modify two files to configure Samba:
# - /etc/samba/smb-dev.conf - which defines the Samba shares when DEV mode is SET from the /dev menu
# - /etc/samba/smb-prod.conf - which defines the Samba shares when DEV mode is UNset from the /dev menu (default)
# After changing the Samba configuration files or DEV mode the new Samba configuration will be activated 
# after reboot.
#
# After setting DEV mode and rebooting you can modify the the Samba configutation files from your PC by 
# mounting the Samba share named 'SambaConfig'.
#
# If you have any concerns you should check the contents of the Samba configuration files. You can modify 
# them as you please. You should study the Samba configuration guides on Internet if you choose to modify the 
# configuration.
#
# If you make Samba shares available in normal operation (DEV mode unset) it is suggested that that 
# these are read only.
#
# It is good practice to add username and password protection to Samba shares. To create usernames see 
# the documentation on internet for the commands useradd, userdel and usermod. Examples of usernames usage 
# are included (commented out) in the configuration files. Samba usernames must also be created as 
# Linux users with the command:
# useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin <username> # to create a user
# userdel <username> # to remove a user
#
# The user must have permissions to act on the files which are shared. Adding the user to a group is 
# easiest way to give permissions to your username when you create it with the command:
# useradd -M -g <groupname> -s /sbin/nologin <username> # to create a user with a primary group
# usermod -g <new_groupname> <username> # to add a primary group to a username
# userdel <username> # to remove a user
# Standard groups are available in Linux with pre-defined permissions, for details see 
# here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/users_and_groups
#
# To set passwords see the documentation on internet for the command smbpasswd. Typical usage is:
# smbpasswd -a <username> # to create a Samba password entry for the username.
# smbpasswd <username> # to modify the Samba password.
# smbpasswd -e <username> # to enable the user for Samba.
# smbpasswd -x <username> # to remove the Samba associated password.
#
# Lines can be disabled by commenting them out with a # or activated by removing the #
#
# You can reset everything back to the defaults by clearing the player ID and then clearing the image in 
# the /dev menu.
#
# Notes:
# With the default configuration below, the free disk space on your local USB drives will be shown as the free
# space on the Micro-SD card. If you change the 'path' in 'MusicStoreUSB' to point to the name of your USB drive
# (the mount point) it will then show the actual available space. For example, if you have a local USB drive
# mounted with the name 'Music', you can change the 'path' to '/mnt/MPD/USB/Music' (it is case sensitive). If you
# have more than one USB disk mounted you could choose to leave the default settings and add extra shares for
# for each large capacity disk.
