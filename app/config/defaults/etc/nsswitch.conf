# Runeaudio hosts command configuration, choose one of the following, Rune disables resolved by detault!
# Standard (will not work correctly with runeaudio):
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns
# IPV4 only:
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mdns4
# IPV6 only:
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname mdns6_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mdns6
# IPV4 & IPV6 configuration line (this is sometimes slow! Use IPV4 if there are performance problems):
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mdns
# IPV4 & IPV6 no resolved v1
# hosts: files mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
# IPV4 & IPV6 no resolved v2
