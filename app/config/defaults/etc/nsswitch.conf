# hosts: files mymachines myhostname resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns
# IPV4 only:
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mdns4
# IPV6 only:
# hosts: files mymachines myhostname mdns6_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mdns6
